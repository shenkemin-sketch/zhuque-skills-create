# Self-Contained Skill Publishing

`zhuque-skills-create` owns the complete optional public release path. Do not invoke a separate publisher after this package is selected unless the user asks for a different release system.

## Capability contract

The bundled `scripts/publish_skill.py` provides governed release safety:

1. strict `SKILL.md` and `manifest.json` identity/version checks
2. MIT `LICENSE` creation when missing
3. README generation or quality validation
4. GitHub owner/repository detection without conflating repository and skill names
5. repository creation with a baseline default branch when needed
6. feature-branch commit and push; direct default-branch push is forbidden
7. pull-request creation, PR gate execution, review/check inspection, and optional merge
8. immutable version guard: an existing `vX.Y.Z` release requires a version bump
9. GitHub Release creation, discovery, isolated clean install, and optional Codex-local sync

## Commands

Read-only audit:

```bash
python3 scripts/publish_skill.py /path/to/skill --dry-run
```

Prepare LICENSE and README locally without GitHub writes:

```bash
python3 scripts/publish_skill.py /path/to/skill --prepare-only
```

Full publication after the user explicitly asks to publish:

```bash
python3 scripts/publish_skill.py /path/to/skill
```

Stop after a passing PR when merge approval must happen elsewhere:

```bash
python3 scripts/publish_skill.py /path/to/skill --no-merge
```

Verify an already released version without creating commits or releases:

```bash
python3 scripts/publish_skill.py /path/to/skill --verify-only
```

Useful target controls:

- `--github-user OWNER`
- `--repo-name REPO`
- `--branch codex/...`
- `--private`
- `--no-sync-local`

## Safety decisions

- Full publication is an external mutation and runs only after an explicit publish request.
- `--dry-run` is read-only; unlike the legacy publisher it does not silently create or modify local files.
- New repositories receive an initial README baseline, then the actual Skill enters through a feature branch and PR.
- Existing repositories never receive `HEAD:main` or equivalent direct pushes.
- Staged content passes secret scanning and `git diff --cached --check` before commit.
- Failed or pending checks, merge conflicts, or requested changes block automatic merge.
- Existing releases are immutable. Publishing new content under the same version is blocked.
- Canonical local sync skips an already-canonical source. Replacing another installed copy first moves it to `$CODEX_HOME/skill-backups`, outside Skill discovery.

## Evidence boundary

The publisher proves package gates, Git/PR/Release state, discovery and installation. It does not prove the created Skill's domain output quality, user satisfaction, adoption or business outcome. Preserve those as separate output/runtime/human evidence or `missing evidence`.
